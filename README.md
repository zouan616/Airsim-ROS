# Airsim-ROS
This repository currently contains

1. communication protocols between Airsim on a host computer and Jetson board

2. Some example missions for drone combined with ROS. 

This reposityory and its code is mainly modified from [MAVbench](https://github.com/harvard-edge/MAVBench). Our goal is to explore how scheduling strategies on ROS can affect the performance of Cyber-physical system. 

To see the documentations for both communication protocols and example missions, please go to **Documentation**
